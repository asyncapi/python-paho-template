# python-paho-template
This is the Python Paho template for the AsyncAPI generator.

It is basically working but not yet ready for prime time. It works correctly with the temperature.yml file included in the samples directory, which demonstrates a subscriber, a publisher, and a payload class with an embedded enum type.

Support for arrays, specifying function names and other features are yet to be implemented.



## About the samples directory

In the samples directory there is an example of code that is close to what we intend to generate.

To run the sample code, copy config-template.ini to config.ini and enter your host and password.
